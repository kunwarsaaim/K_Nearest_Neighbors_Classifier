# K_Nearest_Neighbors_Classifier

+ The kNN algorithm belongs to the family of instance based, competitive learning and lazy learning algorithms.
+ Instance-based algorithm are those algoritms that model the problem using data instances in order to make predictive decisions. The kNN algorithm is an extreme form of instance-based methods because all training observation are retained as part of the model.
